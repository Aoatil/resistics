Conventions
-----------

Resistics adopts a number of conventions which are outlined below:

- Resistics assumes that data is sampled on the second. There is functionality available to interpolate data on to the second. Please see 
- Magnetic channels are named |Hx|, |Hy| and |Hz|
- Electric channels are named |Ex|, |Ey|
- All physical measurements are given in field units
    
    - Electric channels |Ex|, |Ey| are in mV/m
    - Magnetic channels are in V
    - Calibrated magnetic channels are in nT

- Time data conventions are detailed here
- Calibration conventions are outlined here
