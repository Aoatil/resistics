Advanced
--------

This section introduces some of the more advanced features of resistics. These advanced processing needs still use the high-level resistics API. Examples of using lower level APIs can be seen in the :doc:`Cookbook <cookbook>`. For data reading, the low level API is outlined in :doc:`Time series <formats/timeseries>`.

More detail is given about the advanced processing methods below and in the corresponding subsections.

Pre-processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are several use cases requiring pre-processing of time series data.

Remote reference processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remote reference processing is no longer really an advanced method. However, the example
